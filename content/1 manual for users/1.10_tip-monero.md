# Get tips

If you already do something online, like Youtube videos, articles, streaming, running a webcam, or an online radio you can share your Monero address and people can send you anonymous tips.

To do so, the only thing you need is to display your address either in text or as a QR code, or both. You can [get your address from the Monero app you’re using](https://www.notion.so/Receive-64a85a124c9849668aaaa46dc509be92?pvs=21). Put it on the video’s description, the podcast notes, at the footer of your articles, or in your public profiles.

Remember that Monero addresses protect your privacy, so unlike most other cryptocurrencies, if someone knows it, it doesn’t mean they can know how much money you have, how many donations you received, or if you spent them at all.

The same way, you can [use your moneros to contribute to worthy efforts](https://www.notion.so/Give-it-back-3ee8033570c34cdca20140abe5d3be61?pvs=21). Or if you want to help spread the word ask you favorite content creator to accept donations in Monero.
