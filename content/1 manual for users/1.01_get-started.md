Your first step should be getting a Monero **wallet**. This makes total sense, since a wallet in the real world is a thing you put your money in to carry it around, so if you want to store your moneros somewhere, a wallet is what you need.

But you may wonder: isn’t there something better than a wallet if I want to store a lot of money? A wallet doesn’t sound very secure. The answer is: in cryptoland, we call *everything* a wallet, but there are several types of wallets. Some wallets are like pockets on your trousers, some are like a safe inside of a mountain behind three steel doors and hanging above a pool of deadly sharks with head-mounted lasers, and some are kind of in-between.

If you’re new to Monero, and crypto in general, I’d suggest you don’t handle big amounts until you feel confident doing these 3 things in a secure manner:

- [Storing](content/1%20manual%20for%20users/1.03-be_your_own_bank.md)
- [Sending](content/1%20manual%20for%20users/1.12-send_monero.md)

Don’t worry, you’ll get there. Once you do, the sky is the limit.
