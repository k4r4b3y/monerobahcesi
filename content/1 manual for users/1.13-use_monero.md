title: 1.13 Use Monero

Excellent! You already know how to create a wallet, receive and send Monero. That may sound like basic stuff, but believe me, itâ€™s daunting for some people. This already puts you in a very select cypherpunk group!

Some things you can do with you moneros:
- [Buy stuff](content/1%20manual%20for%20users/1.14-buy_with_monero.md)
- [Give or receive tips](content/1%20manual%20for%20users/1.15-tip_monero.md)
- [Donate some to good causes](content/1%20manual%20for%20users/1.17_donate-monero.md)
- [Gift it to loved ones](content/1%20manual%20for%20users/1.16-gift_monero.md)

Or you can just hold it [secret and secure](content/1%20manual%20for%20users/1.05-seed_storage.md), just in case it's the only safe way to enjoy your wealth in the future. We only need a working internet for that. If we don't even have that, well... start practicing archery and good luck.
