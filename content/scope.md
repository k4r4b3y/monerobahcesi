Take a peek at the [[index]] which is another file.

To me, making it a website is the most effective initial form. It's big and clean, and can be accessed almost everywhere. For obvious reasons to this community, it should also be accesible via Tor and i2p. So a working, fully functional website with those three content branches is the scope of this proposal.

The nature of the idea makes it very versatile to use as basis for a book in both physical and electronic forms, a series of animated, narrated videos, or even an app. These formats are outside of the scope of this proposal but if the material is good enough to engage people I think all those mediums would have their merits.

The initial material would be in English, but obviously I see the appeal of having it translated in as many languages as possible, since it's particularly targeted towards newcomers.
