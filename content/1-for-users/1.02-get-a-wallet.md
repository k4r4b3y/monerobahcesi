A Monero wallet is just an app that stores your funds. There are ones that work on your mobile phone, ones for your desktop computer or laptop, and some special ones that work on their own specialized device.

If you don’t know what you’re doing, probably the best compromise between being secure enough and easy to use, is a mobile app.

Here’s a list of Monero wallets that work on phones, with their links:

The reason MyMonero is not there, is because it works differently than the rest. To be super quick, they scan the blockchain for you. This is possible because you’re giving them the keys to see which moneros belong to you, but not the key that allows them to steal them. You are trading some privacy for convenience, which is fine, but you should be aware of the pros and cons before using it.
