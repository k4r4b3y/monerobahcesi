# Extra stuff

Excellent! You already know how to create a wallet, receive and send Monero. That may sound like basic stuff, but believe me, itâ€™s daunting for some people. This already puts you in a very select cryptopunk group!

Some other things you can do with Monero: [mine it](https://www.notion.so/Mine-it-fa2724fec9b94a2baf57ff51c172bb90?pvs=21), [use it for donations](https://www.notion.so/Get-tips-3e72ccf691a743118aa191e8fb4e5bb3?pvs=21), [use it to buy stuff online](https://www.notion.so/Buy-stuff-with-it-38a0dbf33b294c9ea6a04b52e433752f?pvs=21), [donate it to cool projects](https://www.notion.so/Give-it-back-3ee8033570c34cdca20140abe5d3be61?pvs=21), or [give it out as a gift](https://www.notion.so/Give-it-away-8f1bcd99541d46cf8b8344265868a580?pvs=21).
