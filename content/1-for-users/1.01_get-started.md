# Let's get started

Your first step should be getting a Monero wallet. This makes total sense, since a wallet in the real world is a thing you put your money in to carry it around, so if you want to store your moneros somewhere, a wallet is what you need.

But you may wonder: isn’t there something better than a wallet if I want to store a lot of money? A wallet doesn’t sound very secure. The answer is: in cryptoland, we call everything a wallet, but there are several types of wallets. Some are like pocket wallets, some are like a safe inside of a mountain behind three steel doors and deadly lasers, and some are kind of in-between.

If you’re new to Monero, and crypto in general, I’d suggest you don’t handle big amounts until you feel confident doing these 3 things in a secure manner:

- Receiving
- [Storing](https://www.notion.so/Be-your-own-bank-2c47f3c9481b43a7be469674c3d6fff3?pvs=21)
- [Sending](https://www.notion.so/Send-1e1be904c731496fb9380b74155bf1c9?pvs=21)

Don’t worry, you’ll get there. Once you do, the sky is the limit.
