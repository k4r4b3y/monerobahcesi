# Buy it

There are a couple of places where you can just buy Monero. Basically you can buy it from a company, or from another person (that is called _peer-to-peer_, or _p2p_).

An important note: once you receive the moneros you purchased, nobody but you will know what you do with them, or how many you have left. It’s just like taking cash of an ATM. You’re probably filmed and your amount and account recorded when you do it, but what you do afterwards with it is your business.

That’s why most of the legal business options would require that you are over 18 year old and provide documents to disclose your identity. This is not ideal, since there will be a record of you buying Monero. This is not a problem nowadays, but may become one in the future, you can never know.

If you want to buy it from a company and don’t mind being identified:
