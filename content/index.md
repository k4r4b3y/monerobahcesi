title: Welcome to Monero Garden

Take a look at the [[scope]] which is another file.

The Monero Garden would initially be a website available at monero.garden, that worked as a clean and friendly space to start someone's Monero journey. Is a resource I wished many times existed when I told someone about Monero. The naming has two reasons: it acts as a Monero kindergarten of sorts, the starting point of your education, where you learn without any dread; but also as a real garden, with paths you can graciously take and effortlessly stroll at your own pace while discovering new things on the way.

Its language, both visual and writing, should be approachable for a 11 year old and above. Trying my best to keep it clean of technical wording, yet making it engaging for an adult as well. It's a difficult balance but I think it's worth pursuit it.

I want to try a different approach to the rest of Monero content I've seen so far, kind of a Choose Your Own Adventure book, where the questions that pop inside the reader's head guide the consumption of the material, and not presenting (if possible) information that wasn't felt the need for. The aim is relevancy, which should maximize retention and engagement.

I believe that the pre-adolescents are specially important to talk to. They are starting their financial life earlier and earlier, the boundaries of real money and virtual money are going to be as dilluted as ever, so if they find Monero soon enough, they could be a strong agent of change and help avoid the dystopian version of that merge. Believe it or not, we (I'm older than 40 now) are not the future anymore. Luckily we're still the present, so there's a lot we can do!
