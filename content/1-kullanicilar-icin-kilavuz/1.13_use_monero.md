title: 1.13 Use Monero
---
Excellent! You already know how to create a wallet, receive and send Monero. That may sound like basic stuff, but believe me, itâ€™s daunting for some people. This already puts you in a very select cypherpunk group!

Some things you can do with you moneros:
- [Buy stuff](1.14_buy_with_monero.md)
- [Give or receive tips](1.15_tip_monero.md)
- [Donate some to good causes](1.17_donate_monero.md)
- [Gift it to loved ones](1.16_gift_monero.md)

Or you can just hold it [secret and secure](1.05_seed_storage.md), just in case it's the only safe way to enjoy your wealth in the future. We only need a working internet for that. If we don't even have that, well... start practicing archery and good luck.
