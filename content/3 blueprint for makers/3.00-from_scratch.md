title: 3.00 From scratch
---

As supposedly said by Confucius:

>"I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand."

Even though we're limited to *reading* here, let's try to get it as close to *doing* as possible. To do so, let's pretend we're building together Monero from scratch, so we can explore not only how things work but also why someone decide to make it work like that!

Ideally, the current state of Monero will make sense to you. Even better, if something doesn't make total sense, you'll have the tools to make it better. Never forget that no matter how complex or stablished a system looks, it was made chunk by chunk by normal people. People that farts, have biases, and blind spots like anybody else.

To build Monero from scratch, it would be useful to keep in mind what I believe that money is [what I believe that money is](3.01_money-is-a-battery.md), so that my own biases are in the open.
