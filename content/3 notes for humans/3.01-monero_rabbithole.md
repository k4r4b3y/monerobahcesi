title: 3.1 The rabbithole
---
You walk into the path only for a few meters, but you already sense the bushes closing in. The foliage looks certainly different than it did from outside the path. Wind starts picking up, constructing a sound very similar to that of uneven waves coming to the shore. You notice your heart, and even though it doesn’t beat faster or slower, noticing it doing its thing is always weird.

You see nothing dangerous ahead, but you have the feeling that if you go any further, you’ll never come back. Not that you won’t be able to walk the path back, but that the _**you**_ that does that won’t be the same _you_ that is walking forward. We all have those moments in life, this one could be one of yours.

You see a perfect fallen tree trunk on the side of the path and decide to make a stop and just be here for a moment. You close your eyes.

> *I'll keep adding pages to this path as I clean them.
