A good system should be used for those who don't need it.

A system should be easy, convenient, fun, profitable, or any other positive quality enough so it's adopted by those who don't rely on it. Those optional users are the providers of liquidity, of adoption, of decentralization, of development for those who definitely need to use the system, and hopefully are always a minority.

It's tempting to make a moral argument for this. But if we think this through, a communal benefit should be incentive enough. If it's not, the quality of the system should rise to the occasion, so to speak.
