# The Asch conformity experiment 

They put a guy in a room together with other seven fake participants. Like a ring signature. Then they show them a picture like this one, and ask ¿What line is equal to the first line, A, B or C?

Even though there’s a clear correct answer, if the fake participants answer out loud first, and say A for example, the real participant answering last, will give the same wrong answer a third of the time. If you run the experiment 12 times, 75% of them conform to the peer pressure at least once.
