# Giving money to someone should not have strings attached

When you gift a money that allows you to trace everything the receiver does afterwards (and possible before that as well) is a poisoned gift.

Is it truly a gift, or are you just paying for information?

The only way to avoid this is using an amnesic kind of money that doesn't remember.

Forget about the gift. Let's say you're paying for something. If you're getting something extra (the recipient's financial information), what would be the fair value of that? Should you pay more for the privilege?

In that case, using money that is not private should be more expensive. Or putting it the other way around, pay with a private money should be cheaper than anything else.
