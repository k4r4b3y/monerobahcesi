# Pressure release

Entropy tends to increase in the universe, yet people tend to centralize things to maximize order.
That makes a pressure cooker until it boils too much and explodes.
Just like financial regulations. Just like a tyrannical government. Privacy allows for usually meek individuals to opt out in silence and release some of that pressure.
Decentralizing what we do is inefficient, it's messy, but also allows for all the pressure of being ourselves to dissipate more evenly, and not to build so much until we have a earthquake.
