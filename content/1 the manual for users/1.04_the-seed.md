# The mighty seed

You’re going to be your own bank, so the job of keeping your moneros out of other people’s hands is all yours. Remember: with great power comes great responsibility.

Open the app you downloaded, and create a new wallet. You’ll probably be faced with a few choices, but the most important information that you’ll be shown is your _****seed.****_ It may also be called “mnemonic seed”.

The seed It’s a list of random words that you need to write down _very_ carefully. That list is unique to your wallet. No other wallet has the same seed, and it’s so random that someone guessing it would be as unlikely as picking a particular grain of sand from the beaches all around the world. It just won’t happen.

Picture that seed as a real seed, the app will plant it and it’ll sprout a monero wallet. And just like branches and leaves, accounts and addresses grow from that single seed. Think of it as the DNA of your wallet, that DNA is a set of instructions that will always recreate the same wallet. That’s why it’s very important to keep it both _safe_ and _secret_. If you lose it or has an error, you lose the moneros. If someone finds it, they can steal your moneros.

It’s _your_ money, _your_ secret, _your_ seed. **Write it down, and [check it twice](https://www.notion.so/Keep-it-safe-960819529b6d4e9da790712e30377437?pvs=21).**
